## A simple graphics library in C

#### authored by zfgo (github.com/zfgo)

This library is intended to be simple, with few functionalities, and is
mainly intended to be a small project for its author. It also serves as
a way for the author to keep their skills sharp.

The way that the author intends for this library to function is by
creating a canvas of pixels that is stored in memory that the user can
alter using the given library functions. The library may or may not
provide the ability to write that canvas to a file. 

The author is drawing inspiration from the data structures made by his
university professor -- Sventek. These can be found in the book "C and
Data Structures" by Joseph Sventek. The author is also drawing
inspiration from tsoding's graphics library, which can be found at 
"github.com/tsoding/olive.c".
